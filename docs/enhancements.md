# DCBS Codebase Enhancements

This document summarizes the significant enhancements made to the DCBS (Disjunctive Category Beam Search) codebase to improve memory usage, configuration flexibility, and test coverage.

## Tokenizer Caching

A memory-efficient caching system for tokenizer operations has been implemented to reduce redundant operations and improve performance:

- **LRU Cache Implementation**: Uses an OrderedDict with least-recently-used (LRU) eviction policy
- **Separate Encode/Decode Caches**: Maintains separate caches for token encoding and decoding operations
- **Performance Tracking**: Records hit rates and provides periodic stats reporting
- **Configuration Options**: Cache size and reporting interval can be configured in study_config.yaml

Performance tests demonstrate a cache hit rate of >95% for repeated operations, with measurable reduction in processing time.

## Memory Usage Optimization

Several features have been added to reduce and monitor memory usage:

- **Batch Processing**: Examples are now processed in configurable batch sizes
- **Memory Profiling**: Detailed memory usage tracking during key operations (model loading, tokenization, sampling)
- **Garbage Collection Triggers**: Automatic garbage collection when memory exceeds thresholds
- **Peak Memory Recording**: Tracks peak memory usage for critical operations
- **Memory Allocation Tracing**: Optional detailed tracking of Python object allocations

The performance tests confirm that batch processing reduces per-example memory usage by over 95%.

## Improved Logging Configuration

The logging system has been enhanced with:

- **Component-Specific Logging Levels**: Set different verbosity levels for algorithm, evaluation, and visualization components
- **Conditional Debug Logging**: Performance-expensive logging operations are now guarded by level checks
- **Duplicate Log Prevention**: Properly configured logger hierarchy prevents log duplication
- **Configurable Log File Handling**: Controls for file mode and rotation

## Multi-Token Answer Handling

Support for multi-token answers has been enhanced:

- **Full "Combine" Strategy**: Now properly supports handling answers that tokenize to multiple tokens
- **Token Concatenation**: Validates against full concatenated representation of multi-token answers
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Normalized comparison between prediction and correct answer
- **Improved Validation**: More robust token prediction validation with detailed logging

Unit tests confirm the correct handling of multi-token answers with different strategies.

## Test Coverage Expansion

The test suite has been expanded with:

- **Multi-Token Tests**: Dedicated tests for multi-token answer handling
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Tests to measure batch processing and cache efficiency
- **Memory Profiling Tests**: Documentation of memory usage in different configurations
- **Test Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings explaining test objectives and setup
- **Test Runner**: Unified script for running unit and performance tests separately or together

## Configuration Enhancements

The configuration system now supports:

- **Memory Management Settings**: Controls for GC thresholds, batch size, and detailed reporting
- **Component-Specific Logging**: Custom log levels for different components
- **Profiling Options**: Enable/disable memory profiling and allocation tracing
- **Tokenizer Cache Settings**: Configure cache size and reporting frequency

## Conclusion

These enhancements significantly improve the DCBS codebase's memory efficiency, configurability, and test coverage. The implementation of tokenizer caching and batch processing directly addresses the issues seen in the log files, where many multi-token answers were causing errors due to inefficient handling.
