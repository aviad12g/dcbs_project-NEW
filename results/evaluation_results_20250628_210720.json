Most ecosystems are found on land instead of in water. - This statement is false. Most ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and deserts, are found on land, not in water.\n\nC. Carbon dioxide is more available than other gases. - This statement is false. While carbon dioxide is a critical component of the carbon cycle, it is not more available than other gases in most ecosystems. In fact, other gases like oxygen, nitrogen, and water vapor are more abundant in the atmosphere.\n\nD. The producers in all ecosystems are plants. - This statement is false.
