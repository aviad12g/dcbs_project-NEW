# Code Quality Improvements - Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the code quality improvements made to address the identified issues:
- Large modules decomposition
- Function breakdown
- Magic numbers extraction to constants

## 1. Constants Extraction

### Created `src/dcbs/constants.py`
- Extracted all magic numbers and configuration values into a dedicated constants module
- Improves maintainability and makes values self-documenting
- Examples of extracted constants:
  - `MIN_TOKENS_FOR_CLUSTERING = 3`
  - `DEFAULT_K_CLUSTERS = 8`
  - `DEFAULT_TOP_N = 50`
  - `KMEANS_RANDOM_SEED = 42`
  - `PROB_EPSILON = 1e-6`

## 2. Module Decomposition

### Decomposed `dcbs_sampler.py` (427 lines → 326 lines)
Created three new modules to extract functionality:

1. **`src/dcbs/debug.py`** - Debug functionality
   - `DCBSDebugger` class handles all debug-related operations
   - Manages debug mode resolution, logging, and cluster history tracking

2. **`src/dcbs/embedding_ops.py`** - Embedding operations
   - `EmbeddingOperations` class handles all embedding-related functionality
   - Manages embedding retrieval, normalization, and caching

3. **Updated `dcbs_sampler.py`**
   - Now focused solely on the core DCBS algorithm
   - Delegates debug operations to `DCBSDebugger`
   - Delegates embedding operations to `EmbeddingOperations`

### Decomposed `config_schema.py` (493 lines → 274 lines)
Created two new modules:

1. **`src/config_validation.py`** - Configuration validation logic
   - `ConfigValidator` class handles all validation operations
   - Validates fields, types, ranges, and nested structures

2. **`src/env_resolver.py`** - Environment variable resolution
   - `EnvironmentVariableResolver` handles environment variable substitution
   - Manages environment variable overrides and type conversions

## 3. Function Breakdown

### Refactored `_dcbs_selection` method
Broke down the large method into smaller, focused functions:

1. **`_perform_clustering`** - Handles clustering with caching
2. **`_record_selection_decision`** - Records debug information
3. **`_group_by_clusters`** - Groups tokens by cluster labels

Each function now has a single, clear responsibility.

## 4. Benefits Achieved

### Maintainability
- Each module now has a clear, single responsibility
- Functions are smaller and easier to understand
- Constants are centralized and documented

### Testability
- Smaller modules are easier to unit test
- Clear interfaces between components
- All existing tests continue to pass

### Readability
- Code is more self-documenting with named constants
- Reduced cognitive load with smaller files
- Clear separation of concerns

### Extensibility
- Easy to add new clustering algorithms
- Simple to extend debug functionality
- Configuration validation can be enhanced independently

## 5. File Size Comparison

| File | Before | After | Reduction |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| `dcbs_sampler.py` | 427 lines | 326 lines | 24% |
| `config_schema.py` | 493 lines | 274 lines | 44% |

## 6. New Project Structure

```

├── debug.py             # Debug functionality

```

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully addressed all identified code quality issues:
- ✅ Large modules have been decomposed into focused, manageable components
- ✅ Large functions have been broken down into smaller, single-purpose functions
- ✅ Magic numbers have been extracted into well-documented constants
- ✅ All tests continue to pass, ensuring no functionality was broken

The codebase is now more maintainable, testable, and easier to understand.
